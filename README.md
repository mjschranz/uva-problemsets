===============

This repository was made as a way to teach myself better math skills when it comes to solving common Computer Science problems. After seeing [@Pomax](https://github.com/Pomax) post the link in #webmaker (irc.mozilla.org) I was inspired to take on this little challenge for myself. This area of development is without a doubt a weakness of mine so I figure why not use it as an exercise to keep my brain on it's toes!

Feel free to use this material yourself. It's all under MPL 2.0.

Eventually there will be a GH-Pages of this accessible.
